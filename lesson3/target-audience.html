      <h2>Scenarios</h2>
      <div class="scenarios">
      <ol>
        <li class="first">
        The Spirit of Enterprise offers all of its clients the opportunity to present their products and know-how. This with the objectives of:
          <ul>
           <li> Maintain close contact between our Institution and its nationals</li>
          <li>  Create a real business network</li>
          <li>  Promote exchanges and partnership opportunities</li>
          <li>  Promote business networking</li></ul></li>
          
        
      <li class="second"> Benefits and Results:
         <ul> 
         <li>  each company to present itself and describe the activities of its company</li>
        <li>  Organize a melting pot of exchanges and networking for companies</li>
        <li>  Promote partnership opportunities between small businesses</li>
        <li>  Encourage the creation of “international clubs” by sector of activity</li></ul></li>
        
      
       <li class="third"> Free and efficient financial markets are essential to a diverse and growing economy. They allow businesses to succeed and individuals to build financial security. To support that system, we need smart regulation that ensures access to capital and credit, enables companies to go public, incentivizes innovation, and provides choice and access for investors while protecting consumers.</li>

       <li class="fourth"> There are more than 10 million small businesses in Ivory Coast, employing nearly half of the entire Ivorien workforce. Through their resilience, drive, and creativity, these small businesses fuel the Ivorien economy. They build careers, power innovations, and serve communities across the country.</li>

       <li class="fifth"> Businesses everywhere are driving inclusive growth that lifts countries, communities, and people. Because people know what a job means to a family and to a strong community, the public trusts business above all other institutions. We believe in the power of every enterprise, human ingenuity, and business innovation to lead solutions that are practical, sustainable, and profitable.</li>
