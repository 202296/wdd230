    <h1>Demographics</h1>
<p>The District of Abidjan's population was 6,321,017 at the December 14, 2021 census,up from 4,707,404 at the May 15, 2014 census.

Population increase, lower in the 2000s due to the economic crisis and Ivorian Civil War, has picked up in the 2010s to levels unseen since the 1980s thanks to the rapid economic growth experienced by Abidjan after the return of peace in 2012. Many inhabitants come to live in Abidjan for employment and better standards of living.</p>

<p class="explain"> By 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year, doubling every six or seven years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3‚Äì6%. Birth rate growth was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly offseting the arrivals. The migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within C√¥te d'Ivoire, and about 30,000 from abroad per year. From within C√¥te d'Ivoire, the migration pattern was dominated by Akan (South-east, 48%), then Mand√© (North-west, 24%) and Krou (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was Burkinabes (30%), Malians (22%), Ghanaians (19%), Nigerien (11%), and Guineans (9%). Of the non-African migration, Lebanese migration was highest, followed by European migration, with the French being largest of this latter group. All in all, people of non-African origin represent 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which remains the highest in the region.</p></div>

            <figcaption>The Plateau is the central business district of Abidjan, the economic capital of C√¥te d'Ivoire. It is one of the 10 urban communes of the city.  The Plateau is surrounded by the municipality of  Yopougon  to the west, to the south by the √âbri√© Lagoon. As a central  business district, it brings together most of the city's administrative and commercial activities. Most of the large Ivorian firms have their  headquarters in Plateau. It also has a very lively market. Nicknamed by some the  "Little Paris" or "Little Manhattan", the Plateau with its towers and buildings overlooks the √âbri√© Lagoon.  Since the creation of the railway district, to accommodate the terminus of the  Abidjan-Niger railway line, the Plateau has rapidly developed to become the administrative,  commercial and financial center of C√¥te d'Ivoire, and holds an important place in West Africa.  There is also the F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny stadium and the cath√©drale Saint-Paul. One of its  amazing features is to welcome thousands of bats after dark, which gather  above the lagoon to hunt mosquitoes and other insects.</figcaption>

Banco National Park,  top left of Abidjan map. This forest is the green lung of the city of Abidjan and its hydraulic reservoir.  It was classified by the governor as a national park in 1953. Located along the northern highway, the Banco National Park is home to a primary forest of 600 hectares in its center, with species of wood that have become rare ( mahogany , avodir√©s , etc.). There are many birds and monkeys there.  According to a study made in 2004 and 2005 by the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation , a dozen chimpanzees would still  live there. Hiking trails for walkers and 80 km of cycle paths have been laid out there. This national park  is currently threatened by illegal logging and poaching as well as uncontrolled urbanization. To protect  the park, the construction in 2022 of a 10 km long wall was launched. Maintaining the park  costs 200 million CFA francs per year (305,000 euros).</figcaption>
